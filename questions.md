why isn't seeds working.  user seeds work but posts seeds dont work.
i can add to the db on my backend but how would you add to the db on the backend of a website if you can't do it through code
sql commands i guess?

you actually don't need this as you will create this from scratch.


tutor tomorrow.  why am i having problems connect to psql but then it stopped?   i swear i got it working before i tried to do the second set of seeds. maybe not though.

after that ask about the seeds.  dont need them though



i created a new user in the db by using the signup form on login.js but it started at 7
is this because it was running before and wasn't registering?
